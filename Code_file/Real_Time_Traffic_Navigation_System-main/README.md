**Project: Real Time Traffic Navigation System**

This project focusses on the real time traffic navigation system which provide optimal routing between cities considering traffic congestion data dynamically This system uses an AVL Tree which uses for efficiently managing and updating traffic data across different cities and and Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating the shortest path in terms of travel time. 

The primary objective of this project is to enhance route accuracy and efficiency by incorporating real-world constraints such as traffic delays, which are modeled as additional weights on the graph's edges. This approach enables a more realistic navigation experience, considering both distance and congestion levels to minimize travel time.

To download our program, please copy and paste this line to your terminal:

          git clone https://github.com/Ayush-1574/Real_Time_Traffic_Navigation_System.git

Then type: 

         cd .\Real_Time_Traffic_Navigation_System\

Then to run the program / project in visual studio code type these commands:

          g++ project3.cpp
          .\a.exe

Now our program ask input 

**Firstly it ask about the source cities from where you want to travel in the form of the string whose 1st letter is in capital form**

**then it will ask about the destination to where you want to travel in the form of string whose 1st letter is in captial form**

so now our code gives the output the shortest path from  the source city to destination

Also provide the cost needed to travel across the path
and the path in the shortest path which are in red alert / very high traffic
