PROJECT NAME-REAL TIME TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
PROJECT SUMMARY-
This project focusses on the real time traffic navigation system which provide optimal routing between cities considering traffic congestion data dynamically.
This system uses an AVL Tree which uses for efficiently managing and updating traffic data across different cities and and Dijkstra's algorithm
for calculating the shortest path in terms of travel time.
The primary objective of this project is to enhance route accuracy and efficiency by incorporating real-world constraints such as traffic delays, which are modeled as additional weights on the graph's edges. This approach enables a more realistic navigation experience, considering both distance and congestion levels to minimize travel time.
